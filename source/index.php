            <h3>What is this project about?</h3>
            <p>
                The main goal of this project is to design and deliver a complete online system that would provide the possibility for general public to transform structured data into sound. This system has a relatively high potential, as being an online system, it can be much more accessible than any desktop application that requires sophisticated installation process. Additionally, this system would help to improve awareness of public about data sonification through the information provided within the platform about this field. Finally, as an interactive system, it will be potentially more interesting to general public to experiment with it and to explore further data sonification techniques.

            <h3>What is sonification?</h3>
            <p>
                Sonification is considered to be “any technique that uses data as input, and generates (in response to additional excitation or triggering) sound signals” (Hermann, 2008).

            <h3>How can we use sonification?</h3>
            <p>
                Data sonification has a big potential, as there is a range of hidden opportunities in human hearing – for instance, subtle temporal resolution, pattern recognition and eyes free. Data sonification can be used for data analysis, such as financial data analysis and medical observations; data representation; data mining; pattern detection; perception of multiple data streams in parallel; in mobile devices; for reducing cognitive load, as ears fatigue more slowly than eyes (McGee, 2009); etc.
